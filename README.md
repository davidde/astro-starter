## 🚀 Project Structure
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── assets/
│   └── components/
│   └── content/
│   └── layout/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
└── package.json
```

* Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
* There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
* Astro layouts, which are reusable templates that repeat across several pages, go in `src/layouts/`.
* User content goes in `src/content/` as markdown files, and will be generated into complete HTML webpages by Astro, using the pages in `src/pages/`, which themselves use the layout templates in `src/layouts/`.
* Any static assets, like favicon images, can be placed in the `public/` directory, while assets that should be optimized (fonts, images, etc.) can be placed in `src/assets/`.

## 🧞 Commands
All commands are run from a terminal at the root of the project:
